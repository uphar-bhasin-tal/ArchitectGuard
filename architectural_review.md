### Architectural Impact Assessment: Medium

#### Pattern Compliance Checklist:
- [ ] Adheres to SOLID principles
- [ ] Consistent use of design patterns
- [ ] Proper separation of concerns
- [ ] Appropriate abstraction levels
- [ ] Future-proofing considerations

#### Specific Violations Found:
1. **Use of Deprecated Module**: The `cgi` module is deprecated. Its continued use poses a risk for future compatibility and security.
2. **Unused Code**: The `old_calculation` function in `utils.py` is no longer used and should be removed to maintain code cleanliness and reduce technical debt.
3. **Single Responsibility Principle Violation**: The `WebHandler` class is responsible for both handling web data and parsing query strings, which could be separated into distinct responsibilities.

#### Recommended Refactoring:
1. **Replace Deprecated Module**: Transition from the `cgi` module to a more modern alternative like `urllib.parse` for parsing query strings. This change will enhance future compatibility and security.
   - Example refactoring:
     ```python
     from urllib.parse import parse_qs

     class WebHandler:
         def get_field(self, field_name):
             parsed_data = parse_qs(self.query_string)
             return parsed_data.get(field_name, [None])[0]
     ```
2. **Remove Unused Code**: Eliminate the `old_calculation` function from `utils.py` to streamline the codebase.
3. **Enhance Separation of Concerns**: Consider splitting the `WebHandler` class into two classes: one for handling web data and another for parsing query strings. This will improve modularity and adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle.

#### Long-term Implications of the Changes:
- **Improved Maintainability**: By removing deprecated and unused code, the codebase will be easier to maintain and understand.
- **Enhanced Security and Compatibility**: Replacing deprecated modules with modern alternatives will ensure the application remains secure and compatible with future Python releases.
- **Better Modularity**: Refactoring to enhance separation of concerns will make the system more modular, allowing for easier future enhancements and testing.

#### Final Architectural Quality Score: 70

This score reflects the need for refactoring to address deprecated module usage, unused code, and adherence to SOLID principles. Implementing the recommended changes will significantly improve the architectural integrity of the codebase.

**Overall Architectural Score: 70 / 100**
