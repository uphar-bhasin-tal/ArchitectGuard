### Architectural Impact Assessment: Medium

#### Pattern Compliance Checklist:
- [ ] Adheres to SOLID principles
- [ ] Consistent with existing patterns
- [ ] Proper separation of concerns
- [ ] Appropriate use of abstraction
- [ ] Future-proofing considerations

#### Specific Violations Found:
1. **Use of Deprecated Modules**: The `cgi` module is deprecated and should be replaced with a more modern alternative, such as `urllib.parse` for parsing query strings.
2. **Unused Code**: The `old_calculation` function in `utils.py` is not used anywhere in the codebase and should be removed to reduce clutter and potential confusion.
3. **Tight Coupling**: The `WebHandler` class directly uses `cgi.parse_qs`, which ties it to a deprecated module, making future updates more challenging.

#### Recommended Refactoring:
1. **Replace Deprecated Module**: Refactor the `WebHandler` class to use `urllib.parse.parse_qs` instead of `cgi.parse_qs`. This will ensure compatibility with future Python versions and maintain security standards.
   ```python
   from urllib.parse import parse_qs

   class WebHandler:
       def __init__(self, query_string):
           self.query_string = query_string

       def get_field(self, field_name):
           parsed_data = parse_qs(self.query_string)
           return parsed_data.get(field_name, [None])[0]
   ```
2. **Remove Unused Code**: Eliminate the `old_calculation` function from `utils.py` to maintain a clean and maintainable codebase.
3. **Enhance Modularity**: Consider abstracting the query string parsing logic into a separate utility function or module to enhance modularity and reusability.

#### Long-term Implications of the Changes:
- **Maintainability**: Removing deprecated modules and unused code will improve maintainability and reduce technical debt.
- **Future-proofing**: By using modern libraries and adhering to current best practices, the codebase will be more adaptable to future changes and updates.
- **Security**: Eliminating deprecated modules can help mitigate potential security vulnerabilities associated with outdated libraries.

#### Final Architectural Quality Score: 70

This score reflects the need to address deprecated module usage and remove unused code to improve the overall architectural integrity of the codebase. Implementing the recommended changes will enhance the maintainability and future-proofing of the system.

**Overall Architectural Score: 70 / 100**
