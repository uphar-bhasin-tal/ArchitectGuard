### Architectural Impact Assessment: Medium

#### Pattern Compliance Checklist:
- [ ] Adheres to SOLID principles
- [ ] Consistent use of dependency injection
- [ ] Proper separation of concerns
- [ ] Use of modern, non-deprecated libraries
- [ ] Consistent with domain-driven design

#### Specific Violations Found:
1. **Use of Deprecated Library**: The `cgi` module is deprecated. Its usage in `WebHandler` should be replaced with a modern alternative such as `urllib.parse`.
2. **Unused Function**: The `old_calculation` function in `utils.py` is not used anywhere in the codebase and should be removed to reduce clutter.
3. **Lack of Dependency Injection**: The `WebHandler` class directly uses the `cgi` module without any form of dependency injection, making it harder to test and replace in the future.

#### Recommended Refactoring:
1. **Replace Deprecated Functionality**: 
   - Replace `cgi.parse_qs` with `urllib.parse.parse_qs` to ensure future compatibility and maintainability.
   
   ```python
   from urllib.parse import parse_qs
   
   class WebHandler:
       def get_field(self, field_name):
           parsed_data = parse_qs(self.query_string)
           return parsed_data.get(field_name, [None])[0]
   ```

2. **Remove Unused Code**:
   - Remove the `old_calculation` function from `utils.py` to clean up the codebase.

3. **Introduce Dependency Injection**:
   - Consider refactoring `WebHandler` to accept a parsing strategy or function as a dependency. This would allow for easier testing and future changes.

   ```python
   class WebHandler:
       def __init__(self, query_string, parser=parse_qs):
           self.query_string = query_string
           self.parser = parser

       def get_field(self, field_name):
           parsed_data = self.parser(self.query_string)
           return parsed_data.get(field_name, [None])[0]
   ```

#### Long-term Implications of the Changes:
- **Maintainability**: By removing deprecated and unused code, the codebase becomes easier to maintain and understand.
- **Flexibility**: Introducing dependency injection will make the system more flexible and easier to adapt to future changes.
- **Future-Proofing**: Replacing deprecated libraries with modern alternatives ensures the code remains functional and secure in the long term.

#### Final Architectural Quality Score: 65

The codebase requires attention to deprecated libraries and unused code. Implementing the recommended refactorings will improve the architectural integrity and future-proof the system.

**Overall Architectural Score: 65 / 100**
