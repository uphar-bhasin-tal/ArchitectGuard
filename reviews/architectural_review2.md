### Architectural Impact Assessment: Medium

### Pattern Compliance Checklist:
1. **Pattern Adherence**: 
   - The code does not adhere to modern web handling patterns, particularly due to the use of deprecated modules.
   - The utility functions are not encapsulated within a service or utility class, which could improve modularity.

2. **SOLID Compliance**:
   - **Single Responsibility Principle**: The `WebHandler` class is responsible for parsing query strings, which is appropriate. However, it uses deprecated methods.
   - **Open/Closed Principle**: The use of deprecated modules suggests that the code is not open for extension with newer libraries.
   - **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Not applicable in the current context.
   - **Interface Segregation Principle**: Not applicable as there are no interfaces.
   - **Dependency Inversion Principle**: The code directly depends on a deprecated module, which should be abstracted.

3. **Dependency Analysis**:
   - The use of the `cgi` module introduces a dependency on deprecated functionality, which is a significant architectural concern.

4. **Abstraction Levels**:
   - The utility functions are at an appropriate level of abstraction but could benefit from being part of a utility class or module.

5. **Future-Proofing**:
   - The use of deprecated modules severely impacts future-proofing. Transitioning to a modern library like `urllib.parse` is recommended.

### Specific Violations Found:
- Use of the deprecated `cgi` module.
- Presence of unused code (`old_calculation` function) which should be removed to maintain code cleanliness.

### Recommended Refactoring:
1. **Replace Deprecated Module**:
   - Replace `cgi.parse_qs` with `urllib.parse.parse_qs` to ensure compatibility with future Python versions.

2. **Remove Unused Code**:
   - Remove the `old_calculation` function from `utils.py` as it is not used anywhere in the codebase.

3. **Encapsulate Utility Functions**:
   - Consider encapsulating utility functions within a class or a more structured module to improve modularity and maintainability.

### Long-term Implications of the Changes:
- **Maintainability**: Removing deprecated dependencies and unused code will improve maintainability.
- **Scalability**: By adhering to modern patterns, the system will be more scalable and easier to extend.
- **Compatibility**: Transitioning away from deprecated modules ensures compatibility with future Python releases.

### Final Architectural Quality Score: 60

The score reflects the need to address deprecated dependencies and improve modularity. By implementing the recommended changes, the architecture will be more robust and adaptable to future requirements.

**Overall Architectural Score: 60 / 100**
